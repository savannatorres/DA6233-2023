**Important**

If you haven't installed `tidyverse` package before, do this:

Install `tidyverse` package by running the following command in the console. This needs to be done only once so make sure that you don't run it from your Rmarkdown code chunk.

install.packages("tidyverse")

Once the installation is complete, load the library

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```

We will also use a utility library called `here` which helps us locating files in the project folder. Locating files is not an issue when your project directory has no subdirectories. However, that's unlikely. For example, in my case, I stored the data files in a subdirectory called "Data". `here` package makes it easy to reference that subdirectory and the dataset stored within.

Install `here` package by running `install.packages("here")` from your console. 


## Data manipulation


Read the zipped CSV file. Note how I have labeled the code chunk as "data-read". This way I can later easily reference the code chunk if required.

```{r data-read}

dt = read_csv(here::here("tech_stocks_csv.zip"),
              show_col_types = FALSE) # I add this argument to silent the output

```

### Frequency distribution 

```{r get-count-fyear}
count(dt, fyear)
```
```{r}
filter(
  select(dt,conm,fyear),
  fyear == 2009 | fyear == 2023
)
```
```{r}
filter(
  select(dt,conm,fyear),
  !(fyear > 2009 & fyear < 2023)
)
```

```{r get-count-conm}
count(dt, conm)
```


### Select columns

Use `select()` function from `dplyr` package to select columns

In the following example, we will select a handful of columns and then save the resulting dataframe into `dt1`

```{r select}
dt1 = dplyr::select(.data = dt, conm, fyear, sale)
```

Print dt1
```{r print-dt1}
dt1
```


### Creating a new variable

`mutate()` function from `dplyr` allows you to create new variables

The variable `sale` is in million USD. Let's create a new variable `sale_bil` which stores sales in billion USD.

```{r mutate}
mutate(dt1, 
       sale_bil = round(sale / 1000, 0)
       )
```

Create multiple variables

```{r mutate-multiple}
mutate(dt1,
       sale_bil = sale / 1000,
       sale_sq = round(sale_bil^2, 2), # Create square of sales and round it to 2 decimals, sometimes used to see how competitive a market is.
       log_sale = log(sale)) #log of sale is used to normalize so the distribution looks, sometimes distrb is right skewed, variation is lower because the outlier is being 
```

### Summarize data

Base R has `summary()` function that provides basic summary of the variables.
```{r summary}
summary(dt1)

```
```{r}
class(summary(dt1))
```

`summarize()` function from `dplyr` helps in getting summaries as a dataframe.

Use `dt` to get averages of sales, total assets, profits, and advertising


```{r summarize}
summarize(dt,
          sale_mean = mean(sale),
          at_mean = mean(at),
          oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
          xad_mean = mean(xad))

```

```{r missing-xrd}
select(dt, xad)
```



We get a missing value in return for `xad_mean`. This is because by default `mean()` requires non-missing values. We can remove the `NA` from `xad` before taking the mean by using `na.rm` argument inside `mean()`

```{r summarize-xrd}
summarize(dt,
          sale_mean = mean(sale),
          at_mean = mean(at),
          oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
          xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Using `across()` function  to apply a function to multiple columns in `summarize()`
# across needs to be nested inside of another function to work properly
```{r}
summarize(dt,across(c(sale, at, oibdp, xad),mean, na.rm = TRUE))

```


```{r summarize-across}
# if he asks us to save as a data frame use this function as.data.frame()
 temp= summarize(dt,
            across(
              c(sale, at, oibdp, xad), \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), .names = "{.col}_{.fn}_mean"
              )
            )
```


### Summaries by groups.

Next, We want to find the averages of the above variables for each company separately. For this we can use `group_by()` function from `dplyr`

```{r}
dt_grouped = group_by(dt,conm)
```


```{r summarize-group-by}
summarize(
  group_by(dt, conm), # Note how I used group_by
  sale_mean = mean(sale),
  at_mean = mean(at),
  oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
  xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r summarize-group-by2}
summarize(dt,
  sale_mean = mean(sale),
  at_mean = mean(at),
  oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
  xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE),
  .by = conm
  )
```

## Pipes

This is where I would like to introduce the concept of pipes. Consider two steps to create a subset of `dt`. (this is an operator that is also a function)
https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html


```{r pipes-1}
dt1 = select(dt, conm, fyear, sale)
dt2 = filter(dt1, sale > 100000)

```

```{r}
dt2 = filter(
  select(dt, conm, fyear, sale),
  sale > 100000)
```

These two steps can be combined into one step. Can you think of any reasons for why this is useful?

```{r pipes-2}
dt1 = dt %>% select(.data = ., conm, fyear, sale)
```
## you can exclude .data=., from above because r will automatically 
```{r pipes-3}
dt1 = dt %>% select(conm, fyear, sale)
```

```{r} ##in python you can write the function like this.
dt.select(conm, fyear, sale).filter()
```

#look at zoom from here!!

From https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3410/pipe

*A pipe is a method used to pass information from one program process to another. Unlike other types of interprocess communication, a pipe only offers one-way communication by passing a parameter or output from one process to another. The information that is passed through the pipe is held by the system until it can be read by the receiving process. Pipes are primarily used in programming on Unix systems.*

We will use `%>%` to pipe output data from one `tidyverse` function to the next.
This pipe originates from `magrittr` package. Read more about it here: https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html

The keyboard shortcut is 


Shift + Command + M (Mac)
Shift + Control + M (Windows)

As an example, we will select a few variables and then pass them on to summarize using a pipe

```{r pipes-4}
dt %>% 
  select(.data = ., 
         conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  summarize(.data = .,
            sale_mean = mean(sale),
            at_mean = mean(at),
            oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
            xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Can you create grouped means for each company?


```{r pipes-5}
dt %>% 
  select(.data = ., 
         conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  group_by(.data = ., conm) %>% 
  summarize(.data = .,
            sale_mean = mean(sale),
            at_mean = mean(at),
            oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
            xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r pipes-5-simplified}
dt %>% 
  select(conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  group_by(conm) %>% 
  summarize(sale_mean = mean(sale),
            at_mean = mean(at),
            oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
            xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r pipes-6-}
dt %>% 
  select(conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  group_by(conm) %>% 
  summarize(across(
    c(sale, at, oibdp, xad), \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
    )
```
When will the pipe fail?

Case 1. When the object on left does not match the required object to the function on right

```{r pipes-fail-1}
c("A", "B", "C") |> select(conm, fyear, sale)
```

Case 2. When the object on left is passed to incorrect argument of the function on right

```{r lm}
summary(lm(formula = sale ~ at + cogs, data = dt))
```

```{r pipes-fail-2}
dt %>% 
  lm(sale ~ at + cogs) %>% 
  summary()
```


### Joining dataframes

`dplyr` provides several `_join` functions inspired by SQL.

https://learnsql.com/blog/learn-and-practice-sql-joins/

We will create summary of sales by fyear and join it to dt1


```{r join-summary}
dt1_summary = dt1 %>% 
  group_by(fyear) %>% 
  summarize(sale_mean = mean(sale))
```

```{r join-summary-print}
dt1_summary
```


```{r join-summary-filter}
dt1_summary_filtered = dt1_summary %>% 
  filter(fyear > 2009 & fyear < 2023)
```


```{r inner-join}
dt2 = inner_join(dt1, dt1_summary, by = "fyear")
```

```{r print-inner-join}
dt2
```


```{r left-join}
dt3 = left_join(dt1, dt1_summary_filtered, by = c("fyear"))
```


```{r print-left-join}
dt3 
```

### Transposing a dataframe

Sometimes we want to rearrange the information in the columns such that it will appear in rows.

```{r pivot-dt}
dt4 = dt %>% 
  select(conm, fyear, sale, at, xrd)
```

```{r print-pivot-dt}
dt4
```

`pivot_longer()` will transpose a selected subset of columns into two columns by default labeled `name` and `value`

```{r pivot-longer}
dt4 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(sale, at, xrd))
```

You can customize the names of those columns

```{r pivot-longer-custom-names}
dt4 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(sale, at, xrd),
               names_to = "metric_name",
               values_to = "metric_value")
```
